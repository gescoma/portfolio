## The project

Aledo Distribucions is a local business that sells local and galician drinks. They needed a website to show their products and their contact information. It is important to not allow people with less than 18 years old to see the website. Also the client wanted to have diferent prices for diferent client types for example for bars and restaurants they have a price and the particular have another one.

## The process

The client wanted a website that was easy to update and maintain. I decided to use Wordpress as a CMS and I created a custom theme for them. We used woocomerce plugin to create the shop and I used an existing and reputable plugin to manage the age restriction. And another existing plugin to manage the diferent prices for the diferent client types.

## The result

The client was very happy with the result. They can now update the website themselves and they can manage the diferent prices for the diferent client types easily. Also the webpage complies with all the local, national and european laws about age restriction and alcohol online shop.
