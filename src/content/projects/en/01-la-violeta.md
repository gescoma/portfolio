## The project

La Violeta is a social club in the neighborhood of Gracia, Barcelona. They needed a website to show their activities, their history and their events and show the availability of their rooms.

## The process

The client wanted a website that was easy to update and maintain. I decided to use Wordpress as a CMS and I created a custom theme for them. I also created a custom plugin to manage the availability of the rooms.

## The result

The client was very happy with the result. They can now update the website themselves and they can manage the availability of the rooms easily.
